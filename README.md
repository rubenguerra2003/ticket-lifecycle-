<h3 align="center">Intake</h3>
<br />
<p>
  User Ken creates a ticket:
</p>
<p>

</p>
<br />
<br />
<h3 align="center">Ticket assignment</h3>
<br />
<p>
  Support agent John Doe logs in.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<br />
<br />
<h3 align="center">Communication</h3>
<br />
<p>
  Agent John sees this is Sev-A emergency ticket and has to reassign ticket to a System Administrator.
</p>
<p>
  He makes sure to leave a proper message:
</p>
<p>
  
 ![put ticket to sev a](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/703fc35d-1341-41e8-ac9a-63424859fbac)

</p>
<br />
<br />
<h3 align="center">Working the issue</h3>
<br />
<p>
  System Administrator agent Jane Doe logs in:
</p>
<p>
  
![jane logs in](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66990eac-88b8-4242-baa3-42e7c181ddd8)

</p>
<p>
  Agent Jane works the issue and communicates back to agent John.
</p>
<p>
  She also makes sure to switch the status of the issue from open to resolved:
</p>
<p>
  
  ![jane solved problem](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/421fa0c0-f8ca-4197-ab19-398012d6bc9c)

</p>
<br />
<br />
<h3 align="center">Resolution</h3>
<br />
<p>
  Support agent John sees in his portal that System Administrator agent Jane has left him a message and that the ticket is now closed:>
</p>
<p>
  
 ![resolved](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1678946e-2604-495b-8a55-263e2b02019c)
 
</p>
<br />
<br />
<p>
  This was a very simplistic scenario of the creation of a ticket by a user, how the ticket is assigned and displays the communication of a ticket between agents; subsequently resulting in a resolution.
</p>
<p>
  There are additional scenarios that can also happen while a ticket is being assessed. A ticket can either be reassigned to a different department, escalated in severeity level, or needs to be both reassigned to a more qualified agent/department to handle the issue, depending on business impacts.
</p>
<p>
  I hope this tutorial helps you understand and have a better general overview of a life-cycle of a ticket. Help desk agents can expect to regularly deal with anywere between 10 to 100 tickets during their day depeneding on the company size.
